   - Auto-populated forms with transaction data parsing
   - Visual transaction preview with original text display

2. **Transaction-to-Entry Conversion Utilities**
   - Smart UK provider detection (20+ patterns including British Gas, E.ON, Netflix)
   - Intelligent entry type determination (bill, investment, property, policy)
   - Payment date extraction and direct debit detection
   - Comprehensive validation with user-friendly error messages

3. **Bank Import Integration**
   - Added "Create Entry" buttons to all transaction rows
   - Integrated modal state management
   - Bulk selection capability for future batch processing
   - Visual indicators for processed transactions

4. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - 28 passing tests for transaction conversion utilities
   - 16 passing tests for category suggestion service integration
   - Edge case handling for UK-specific scenarios
   - Validation testing for all conversion functions

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### Files Created/Modified

**New Components:**
- `web/src/components/CreateEntryFromTransactionModal.tsx` - Main conversion modal
- `web/src/utils/transactionToEntryConverter.ts` - Core conversion utilities
- `web/src/utils/__tests__/transactionToEntryConverter.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

**Modified Files:**
- `web/src/pages/BankImport.tsx` - Integrated modal and state management

### Key Features Implemented

**Smart Provider Detection:**
- Recognizes major UK providers: British Gas, E.ON, Thames Water, Council Tax
- Handles telecoms: BT, Three, Vodafone, O2
- Streaming services: Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify
- Insurance providers: Aviva, Direct Line, Admiral
- Fallback extraction for unknown providers

**Intelligent Form Pre-population:**
- Auto-extracts amounts, payment dates, direct debit status
- Generates appropriate entry titles (e.g., "British Gas Gas Bill")
- Determines entry types based on transaction patterns
- Populates notes with transaction history and confidence scores

**Category Suggestion Integration:**
- Real-time API calls to category suggestion service
- Visual confidence scoring with detailed reasoning
- One-click application of suggested categories
- Fallback handling for API failures

## ðŸ“Š Current Project Status

### Development Phases Complete

**Phase 0: Core Infrastructure** âœ… COMPLETED
- Authentication, database, basic CRUD operations

**Phase 1-3: Enhanced Functionality** âœ… COMPLETED  
- Specialized forms, pension management, advanced categorization

**Phase 4: Bank Statement Processing** âœ… LARGELY COMPLETED
- PDF import, pattern recognition, transaction conversion
- **Remaining**: Bulk processing implementation (Task 5)

### Architecture Overview

The system now provides a complete bank import workflow:

1. **PDF Upload** â†’ Statement parsing with transaction extraction
2. **Pattern Recognition** â†’ Recurring payment detection with confidence scoring  
3. **Transaction Display** â†’ Organized table with selection capabilities
4. **Entry Creation** â†’ Smart form pre-population with category suggestions
5. **Validation** â†’ Comprehensive error checking and user feedback

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### Immediate Priority: Task 5 - Bulk Processing Implementation

**Remaining Work:**
- Bulk creation API endpoint for processing multiple transactions
- Batch processing interface with progress tracking
- Error handling for partial bulk failures
- Testing for bulk operations

**Estimated Effort:** Medium (1-2 development sessions)

### Files to Implement:
- API endpoint: `src/routes/bulkEntries.js` 
- Bulk modal: `web/src/components/BulkCreateEntriesModal.tsx`
- Error handling utilities
- Comprehensive testing for edge cases
