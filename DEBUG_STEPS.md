# Debugging: Vehicle Entity Creation Not Working

## Critical Questions to Answer

### 1. Initial 404 Error
**Question**: What is the exact URL of the 404 error that appears BEFORE creating a vehicle?

**How to find it**:
- Open DevTools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Navigate to /vehicles-new page
- Look for any RED failed requests
- Click on the failed request and copy the full URL from "Request URL"

**Why this matters**: This will tell us if it's:
- An old route that doesn't exist
- An image endpoint being called prematurely
- An authentication issue (should be 401, not 404)

### 2. Entity Creation POST Request
**Question**: When you create a vehicle, does the POST request actually succeed?

**How to find it**:
- Keep Network tab open
- Click "Add First Vehicle"
- Fill in name: "Test Vehicle"
- Click "Create"
- In Network tab, look for POST to `/api/v2/vehicles`
- Check the response:
  - **Status**: Should be 201 (Created) not 400/404/500
  - **Response body**: Should show the created entity with an `_id`
  - **Request body**: Should show your vehicle data

**Report back**:
- Status code
- Full response body (even if it's an error)

### 3. List API Request
**Question**: When the page first loads, does it successfully fetch the list?

**How to find it**:
- In Network tab, look for GET request to `/api/v2/vehicles`
- Check:
  - **Status**: Should be 200
  - **Response**: Should show `{ entities: [], page: 1, limit: 50, total: 0 }`

**Report back**:
- Status code
- Response body

---

### 4. Authorization Check
**Question**: Are authentication cookies being sent with requests?

**How to find it**:
- Click on the GET `/api/v2/vehicles` request in Network tab
- Go to "Headers" section
- Look for "Cookie" header
- Should contain `connect.sid=...` (session ID)

**Report back**:
- Is there a `Cookie` header?
- What does it contain?

## What Each Could Mean

| Finding | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| 404 before creation | Route not registered or auth issue | Check server is running, check route registration |
| POST returns 201 but entity not in DB | Entity not actually saved in `onSuccess` callback | Check mutation hook |
| POST returns 404 | Authentication failing or wrong route | Check auth middleware, route format |
| GET returns empty array | Query not matching created entity | Check userId/domainType match |
| No Cookie header | Session not established | Need to login first |

## Steps to Provide Maximum Info

1. **Before creating vehicle**:
   - Take screenshot of Network tab showing all requests
   - Highlight any 404/error requests

2. **Create vehicle**:
   - Fill in "Test Vehicle" as name
   - Click Create
   - Immediately pause Network tab (pause button)

3. **Take screenshot of Network tab showing**:
   - The POST to /api/v2/vehicles
   - Click it and show me:
     - Request URL
     - Request Method
     - Status Code
     - Request Headers (especially Cookie header)
     - Request Body
     - Response (first 200 characters)

This information will let me pinpoint the exact issue!
