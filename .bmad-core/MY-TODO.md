## üéì BMAD Learning Notes

### What I've Learned So Far

**Mistake:** I completed Story 1.3 as backend features instead of UI (PRD divergence)
**Learning:** Always check PRD story description before starting implementation
**Fix:** Created Story 1.4 to get UI back on track

### Key BMAD Principles to Remember

1. **One story at a time** - Don't create multiple stories ahead
2. **Follow the 4-step process:**
   - Step 1: PM creates story spec
   - Step 2: Dev implements with tests
   - Step 3: Git commits & PRs
   - Step 4: PM marks complete
3. **Always reference story file** when coding
4. **Verify acceptance criteria** before marking complete
5. **Run regression tests** to ensure nothing broke

## üîç When I Get Stuck

**Problem:** Don't know which story to work on next
**Solution:** Use `/BMad:agents:pm` and ask "What's next?"

**Problem:** Story is too vague or missing details
**Solution:** Ask PM agent to review and enhance story specification

**Problem:** Implementation differs from story spec
**Solution:** Update story file with "Dev Notes" section explaining deviation

**Problem:** Tests failing after changes
**Solution:** Don't commit! Fix tests first, then commit

**Problem:** Forgot which agent to use
**Solution:** Read `.bmad-core/BMAD-WORKFLOW.md`

## üìä Project Health Metrics

**Total Tests:** 60 (25 Story 1.1 + 22 Story 1.2 + 13 Story 1.3)
**Test Pass Rate:** 100% ‚úÖ
**Backend Stories Complete:** 3/9 (33%)
**Frontend Stories Complete:** 0/9 (0%)
**Overall Epic 1 Progress:** 3/9 stories (33%)

**Next Milestone:** Complete Story 1.4 (first UI story) - **IN PROGRESS**

---

## üí° Tips for Success

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Read the story file completely before starting
- Break work into sessions (don't try to do 12 hours straight)
- Commit after each session
- Test frequently (don't wait until the end)
- Ask PM agent for clarification if story is unclear

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Skip reading the story specification
- Code without tests
- Mark story complete without verifying all acceptance criteria
- Create new stories without finishing current one
- Forget to update this tracker file!

**Remember:** BMAD keeps you on track. Trust the process! üöÄ
