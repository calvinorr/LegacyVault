## Overview

Implement secure PDF bank statement import functionality that automatically extracts transaction data, detects recurring payments (utilities, subscriptions, direct debits), and suggests these for addition to LegacyLock's household financial records. This feature enables UK couples to quickly populate their financial vault by analyzing existing bank statements rather than manually entering every recurring payment.

## User Stories

### PDF Bank Statement Import

As a LegacyLock user, I want to upload a PDF bank statement from my UK bank, so that the system can automatically identify all my regular household bills and suggest them for addition to my financial vault.

The user selects a PDF bank statement file from their computer. The system securely processes the document locally, extracting all transaction data including dates, payees, amounts, references, and running balances. No data leaves the user's local environment during processing.

### Recurring Payment Detection & Categorization

As a user reviewing my imported bank data, I want the system to automatically detect which transactions are recurring bills, so that I can quickly add utilities, subscriptions, and other regular payments to my household records.

The system analyzes extracted transactions to identify patterns - matching payees, consistent amounts, regular payment intervals. It categorizes these as direct debits, standing orders, subscriptions, rent/mortgage payments, utility bills, council tax, insurance, and other recurring charges. One-off or irregular transactions are excluded from suggestions.

### Review & Confirmation Workflow

As a user presented with suggested recurring bills, I want to review, edit, and confirm each suggestion before it's added to my vault, so that I maintain control over what gets stored in my financial records.

The system presents a user-friendly interface showing detected recurring payments with editable details including provider name, payment type, amount, frequency, and category. Users can accept, edit, ignore, or merge suggestions. Accepted suggestions automatically create new entries in the Utilities/Recurring Bills section with proper UK-specific categorization.

## Spec Scope

1. **PDF Upload & Processing** - Secure local upload and parsing of UK bank statement PDFs with extraction of transaction data
2. **Recurring Payment Detection** - Pattern analysis to identify regular payments with categorization by type and frequency
3. **User Review Interface** - Interactive dashboard for reviewing, editing, and confirming suggested recurring bills
4. **Data Integration** - Seamless creation of new Utility/Recurring Bill records from accepted suggestions
5. **Privacy & Security Controls** - Local-only processing with optional deletion of raw statement data post-analysis

## Out of Scope

- CSV or OFX format imports (future enhancement)
- Integration with Open Banking APIs
- Automatic categorization of one-off transactions
- Budget analysis or spending insights
- Export functionality for processed data
- Multi-statement bulk processing in initial release

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can upload PDF bank statements through a secure local interface and view extracted transaction data
2. System automatically detects and categorizes recurring payments, presenting suggestions in an editable review interface
3. Users can confirm suggestions which automatically create properly categorized Utility/Recurring Bill entries in their LegacyLock vault
