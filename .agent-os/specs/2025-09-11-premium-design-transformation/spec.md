## Overview

Transform LegacyLock from a functional financial vault app into a premium, minimalist Swiss spa aesthetic that professionals would pay thousands for. This is a visual transformation focused on achieving Steve Jobs-level attention to detail while preserving all existing functionality.

## User Stories

### Premium User Experience

As a professional user, I want the financial vault to feel like a luxury experience, so that managing my finances becomes a pleasure rather than a chore.

The app should evoke the feeling of entering an exclusive Swiss spa or private banking suite - clean, sophisticated, and meticulously crafted. Every interaction should feel premium, from the moment users log in to when they complete complex financial tasks.

### Design Consistency

As a user, I want every component to follow consistent design patterns, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional throughout.

All typography, spacing, colors, and interactions should follow a unified design system. No element should feel out of place or inconsistent with the premium aesthetic.

### Icon Excellence

As a user, I want clean, professional icons instead of emojis, so that the interface feels mature and business-appropriate.

Replace all emoji usage with carefully selected Lucide React icons that maintain visual consistency and professional appearance across all components.
