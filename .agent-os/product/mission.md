## The Problem

### Scattered Financial Information

UK households struggle to maintain organized records of their financial accounts, utilities, and policies across multiple providers. Critical information like sort codes, account numbers, policy details, and emergency contacts are often stored in different systems, making household financial management inefficient and risky.

**Our Solution:** Centralized secure vault with UK-specific field types and terminology.

### Lack of Secure Partner Sharing

Couples need to share sensitive financial information but existing solutions don't provide secure, controlled access with proper UK financial data handling and emergency succession planning.

**Our Solution:** Partner-based sharing with approval workflows and UK data protection compliance.

### Generic International Tools

Most financial management tools use US banking terminology and workflows, creating confusion and incompatibility with UK financial systems like sort codes, building societies, ISAs, and UK pension schemes.

**Our Solution:** Built specifically for UK financial system with proper terminology, date formats, and account types.

### Emergency Access Planning

When one partner handles most financial administration, the other partner often lacks visibility and access to critical account information, creating vulnerability during emergencies or succession planning.

**Our Solution:** Transparent sharing system with emergency access protocols and beneficiary planning.

## Differentiators

### UK Financial System Native

Unlike generic international tools, LegacyLock is built specifically for UK banking with sort codes (XX-XX-XX format), current accounts, building societies, ISAs, SIPPs, Premium Bonds, and UK-specific utilities like Council Tax and TV Licence.

### Couples-Focused Architecture

Unlike individual financial tools, LegacyLock is designed around the concept of shared household management with secure partner access, approval workflows, and succession planning built into the core architecture.

### Security-First Design

Unlike basic spreadsheets or document storage, LegacyLock provides Google OAuth authentication, admin approval workflows, confidential data handling, and proper session management designed for sensitive financial information.
