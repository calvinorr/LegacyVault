# Product Mission (Lite)

LegacyLock is a secure financial vault that helps UK couples manage and store household financial details by providing a centralized, secure platform for bank accounts, utilities, pensions, and policies with UK-specific terminology and workflows.

LegacyLock serves UK couples who need secure shared access to household financial information across multiple providers and account types. Unlike generic international tools, LegacyLock provides native UK financial system support with sort codes, building societies, ISAs, and UK-specific utilities, combined with couples-focused sharing and emergency access planning.
