## 2025-09-07: Initial Product Architecture

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead

### Decision

LegacyLock will be built as a dual-stack application with Node.js/Express backend and React/TypeScript frontend, using MongoDB for data storage and Google OAuth for authentication, specifically targeting UK couples managing household finances.

### Context

Need to create a secure financial vault for UK couples with specific requirements for UK banking terminology (sort codes vs routing numbers), UK financial products (ISAs, SIPPs), and secure partner sharing capabilities.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Single-page React app with local storage**
   - Pros: Simple deployment, no server needed
   - Cons: No secure sharing, data not persistent, no authentication

2. **Rails application with server-side rendering**
   - Pros: Mature framework, good for CRUD operations
   - Cons: Less flexible for complex UI interactions, team more familiar with Node.js

3. **Next.js full-stack application**
   - Pros: Single framework, good SEO, API routes built-in
   - Cons: More complex deployment, less clear separation of concerns

### Rationale

Dual-stack architecture chosen for clear separation between API and frontend, enabling future mobile app development, better security boundaries, and team expertise with Express/React stack. MongoDB provides flexible schema for diverse financial account types.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Clear API boundaries enable future expansion
- Flexible MongoDB schema handles varied account types
- React frontend provides responsive user experience
- Google OAuth eliminates password management concerns

**Negative:**
- More complex deployment than single-stack
- Two separate codebases to maintain

## 2025-09-11: Transaction-to-Entry Conversion Architecture

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Related Spec:** @.agent-os/specs/2025-09-10-bank-import-bills-integration/

### Decision

Implement a comprehensive transaction-to-entry conversion system using intelligent UK provider detection, fuzzy string matching for category suggestions, and a dedicated CreateEntryFromTransactionModal component rather than extending existing AddBillModal.

### Context

With PDF bank statement import functionality complete, users needed an efficient way to convert imported transactions into structured vault entries. The system needed to handle UK-specific banking terminology and provider patterns while providing intelligent category suggestions.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Extend existing AddBillModal with transaction props**
   - Pros: Reuses existing code, consistent UI
   - Cons: Complex conditional logic, cluttered interface

2. **Simple copy-paste workflow for manual entry**
   - Pros: Simple implementation, user has full control
   - Cons: Poor user experience, error-prone, time-consuming

3. **Fully automated entry creation without user review**
   - Pros: Fastest workflow, no user intervention needed
   - Cons: Risk of incorrect categorization, no user control

### Rationale

Custom CreateEntryFromTransactionModal chosen to provide:
- Clean separation of concerns from existing bill creation flows
- Optimized UI specifically for transaction conversion workflow
- Real-time category suggestions with confidence scoring
- Full user control with intelligent pre-population
- Comprehensive UK provider pattern recognition

### Implementation Details

- **Smart Provider Detection**: 20+ UK provider patterns (British Gas, E.ON, Netflix, etc.)
- **Fuzzy String Matching**: Levenshtein distance algorithm for flexible matching
- **Category Suggestion Engine**: Confidence scoring with RecurringDetectionRules integration
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 44 passing tests covering all conversion scenarios
- **UK Financial Focus**: Sort codes, direct debit detection, council tax handling

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Significant reduction in manual data entry time
- High accuracy category suggestions (85%+ confidence typical)
- Seamless integration with existing bank import workflow
- Comprehensive test coverage ensures reliability
- UK-specific patterns provide excellent local accuracy

**Negative:**
- Additional component maintenance overhead
- Dependency on pattern matching rules requiring periodic updates
- Complex testing scenarios for edge cases
- Additional infrastructure overhead

## 2025-09-07: UK-Specific Financial Terminology

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, UX Lead

### Decision

All forms, UI text, and data models will use UK financial terminology exclusively: sort codes (XX-XX-XX), current accounts, building societies, ISAs, SIPPs, Council Tax, TV Licence.

### Context

Generic financial tools use US terminology (routing numbers, checking accounts) which creates confusion and friction for UK users. Need to provide native UK experience.

### Rationale

UK market focus requires authentic terminology to build user trust and reduce cognitive load. Sort codes are distinctly different from routing numbers in format and usage.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Native UK user experience
- Reduced user confusion and errors
- Builds trust with UK financial terminology
- Enables UK-specific integrations later

**Negative:**
- Limits international expansion without localization
- Custom validation logic for UK-specific formats

## 2025-09-07: Couples-Focused Sharing Model

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Security Lead

### Decision

Authentication and data access will be designed around household sharing with Google OAuth, admin approval workflow, and confidential data controls rather than individual accounts.

### Context

Target users are couples managing shared finances who need secure but transparent access to household financial information with emergency access planning.

### Rationale

Differentiate from individual finance tools by building sharing and approval workflows into core architecture rather than adding later as afterthought.

### Consequences

**Positive:**
- Purpose-built for target user workflow
- Security controls designed for sensitive shared data
- Emergency access capabilities from day one
- Clear value proposition vs individual tools

**Negative:**
- More complex authentication flows
- Admin approval creates potential access delays
- Single point of failure if admin unavailable
