## üéì BMAD Learning Notes

### What I've Learned So Far

**Success:** Used PM agent to create all remaining Epic 1 story specs in one session
**Learning:** Planning all stories upfront gives clear roadmap and prevents scope creep
**Benefit:** Dev agent can now work through stories sequentially without waiting for PM

### Key BMAD Principles to Remember

1. **One story at a time** - Implement sequentially, don't skip ahead
2. **Follow the 4-step process:**
   - Step 1: PM creates story spec ‚úÖ (Done for Stories 1.6-1.9)
   - Step 2: Dev implements with tests
   - Step 3: Git commits & PRs
   - Step 4: PM marks complete
3. **Always reference story file** when coding
4. **Verify acceptance criteria** before marking complete
5. **Run regression tests** to ensure nothing broke

---

## üîç When I Get Stuck

**Problem:** Don't know which story to work on next
**Solution:** Follow the Story Progress Tracker above (currently Story 1.6)

**Problem:** Story is too vague or missing details
**Solution:** All stories are now fully specified - read the story file

**Problem:** Implementation differs from story spec
**Solution:** Update story file with "Dev Notes" section explaining deviation

**Problem:** Tests failing after changes
**Solution:** Don't commit! Fix tests first, then commit

**Problem:** Forgot which agent to use
**Solution:** Read `.bmad-core/BMAD-WORKFLOW.md`

---

## üí° Tips for Success

‚úÖ **Do:**
- Read the story file completely before starting
- Break work into sessions (Story 1.6: 6-8 hours = 1-2 sessions)
- Commit after each session with descriptive messages
- Test frequently (don't wait until the end)
- Update this tracker after completing each story
- Use Property/Vehicles domains as templates (proven pattern)

‚ùå **Don't:**
- Skip reading the story specification
- Code without tests
- Mark story complete without verifying all acceptance criteria
- Jump between stories (finish one before starting next)
- Forget to update this tracker file!

## üéØ Recommended Story Implementation Order

**Phase 1: Complete Individual Domain UIs (Stories 1.6-1.7)**
1. Story 1.6: Finance Domain UI (6-8 hours)
2. Story 1.7: Remaining Domains UI (12-16 hours, 2-3 sessions)

**Phase 2: Cross-Domain Features (Stories 1.8-1.9)**
3. Story 1.8: Enhanced Renewal Dashboard (8-12 hours, 2 sessions)
4. Story 1.9: Emergency View (6-10 hours, 1-2 sessions)

**Total Estimated Time:** 32-46 hours across ~8-12 development sessions

**Benefits of this order:**
