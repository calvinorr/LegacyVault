# Epic 1: Life Domain Architecture Foundation

**Epic ID:** 1
**Epic Name:** Life Domain Architecture Foundation
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Created:** 2025-10-04
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-04

---

## Epic Goal

Establish the backend infrastructure and data architecture for the 8 life domains (Property, Vehicles, Employment, Government, Finance, Insurance & Protection, Legal & Estate, Household Services), enabling domain-specific record management while preserving all existing functionality and data integrity.

---

## Epic Description

### Existing System Context

**Current Functionality:**
- Abstract "bills/categories" structure for all household records
- Google OAuth authentication with admin approval workflow
- Multi-user access and sharing capabilities
- PDF/document upload and linking to records
- Bank statement import (HSBC multi-line transaction support)
- UK financial renewal tracking (40+ product types)
- MongoDB backend with Mongoose ODM
- React/TypeScript frontend

**Technology Stack:**
- Backend: Node.js v18+ / Express v4.x / MongoDB v6.x
- ODM: Mongoose v7.x
- Auth: Passport.js + Google OAuth 2.0
- Database: MongoDB Atlas (production), Docker (local dev)
- Frontend: React 18+ / TypeScript / Vite
- Testing: Jest + Supertest + MongoDB Memory Server

**Integration Points:**
- User authentication system (preserve existing auth flow)
- Document storage system (GridFS integration needed)
- Existing bills/categories collections (maintain during transition)
- Frontend API consumption (new endpoints alongside existing)

### Enhancement Details

**What's Being Added:**

This epic transforms the abstract "bills and categories" structure into a **domain-based architecture** with 8 specialized life domains. Each domain has:

1. **Domain-Specific Mongoose Schemas** - Tailored data models with relevant fields
2. **Domain CRUD APIs** - RESTful endpoints for record management
3. **Document Storage Integration** - GridFS for attaching files to domain records
4. **Domain Record Management** - Validation, search, filtering, export, and audit trail
5. **User Isolation** - Multi-user support with proper record filtering

**How It Integrates:**

- New domain collections created **alongside** existing bills/categories (no destructive changes)
- New `/api/domains/*` endpoints registered in Express app
- GridFS integration uses existing MongoDB connection
- Existing auth middleware (`requireAuth`) used for all new endpoints
- Frontend can gradually adopt new endpoints while old ones remain functional

**Success Criteria:**

- ✅ All 8 domain Mongoose schemas created with common + domain-specific fields
- ✅ CRUD API endpoints functional for all domains with proper authentication
- ✅ Document upload/download via GridFS integrated with domain records
- ✅ Domain record validation and management features (search, filter, export, audit trail)
- ✅ 100% test coverage for new domain infrastructure
- ✅ Existing Google OAuth and user management unchanged
- ✅ Performance: API response times < 200ms for record queries

### ✅ Story 1.2: GridFS Document Storage Integration
**Status:** Complete
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 6-10 hours (1-2 sessions)
**Dependencies:** Story 1.1 (Complete ✓)

**Goal:**
Enable file upload/download functionality using MongoDB GridFS, allowing users to attach documents (PDFs, images, etc.) to any domain record.

**Key Deliverables:**
- GridFS storage setup with MongoDB connection
- Document upload API endpoint (`POST /api/domains/:domain/records/:id/documents`)
- Document download API endpoint (`GET /api/documents/:fileId`)
- Document listing for record (`GET /api/domains/:domain/records/:id/documents`)
- Document deletion API endpoint (`DELETE /api/documents/:fileId`)
- File metadata storage (filename, mimetype, uploadDate, uploader)
- Integration with `documentIds` array in domain records
- File size limits and type validation
- Comprehensive tests for upload/download/delete

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users can upload multiple documents to a domain record
- Uploaded files stored in GridFS with proper metadata
- Documents can be downloaded via secure endpoint
- Document list shows all files attached to a record
- Only record owner can upload/delete documents
- File validation prevents malicious uploads
- Existing document upload functionality preserved

### ✅ Story 1.3: Domain Record Management & Validation
**Status:** Complete
**Priority:** Medium
**Estimated Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Dependencies:** Story 1.1 (Complete ✓), Story 1.2 (Complete ✓)

**Goal:**
Enhance domain record management with advanced validation, search capabilities, and business logic specific to each domain type.

**What Was Delivered:**
- Domain-specific validation rules (UK sort code, NI number, registration plate, postcode formats)
- Search/filter endpoints for domain records with text search and date ranges
- Sorting by multiple fields (createdAt, renewalDate, priority)
- Record duplication detection middleware (prevent duplicate accounts/policies)
- Bulk export operations (JSON/CSV formats)
- Record history/audit trail (createdBy, lastModifiedBy, history array)
- Advanced query support with filtering by priority and renewal dates

**Files Created:**
- `src/utils/ukValidation.js` (UK format validation utilities)
- `src/middleware/domainValidation.js` (domain-specific validators)
- `src/middleware/duplicateDetection.js` (duplicate prevention)
- `tests/api/domain-management.test.js` (13 validation tests)

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
- ✅ UK-specific validation works (sort codes, NI numbers, registration plates, postcodes)
- ✅ Users can search records within a domain
- ✅ Duplicate detection prevents accidental re-entry
- ✅ Audit trail shows record modification history
- ✅ Export functionality generates valid CSV/JSON
- ✅ All 13 new tests passing
- ✅ All 25 Story 1.1 regression tests passing

## Compatibility Requirements

### Existing APIs Remain Unchanged
- ✅ `/auth/*` routes (Google OAuth flow)
- ✅ `/api/users/*` routes (user management)
- ✅ `/api/entries/*` routes (legacy bills/categories)
- ✅ `/api/categories/*` routes (category management)
- ✅ `/api/import/*` routes (bank statement import)

### Database Schema Changes
- ✅ New domain collections created alongside existing collections
- ✅ Existing collections (`bills`, `categories`, `users`) untouched
- ✅ GridFS bucket created for document storage
- ✅ Backward compatible: old and new systems coexist

### UI Compatibility
- ✅ Existing UI continues to function with legacy APIs
- ✅ New domain APIs available for gradual frontend adoption
- ✅ Authentication flow unchanged

### Performance Impact
- ✅ New endpoints use proper indexing (minimal performance impact)
- ✅ GridFS streaming prevents memory issues with large files
- ✅ User filtering indexed for fast queries

## Risk Mitigation

### Primary Risks

**Risk 1: Breaking Existing Functionality**
- **Severity:** High
- **Mitigation:**
  - New collections created alongside old ones (no deletions)
  - Existing API routes untouched
  - Comprehensive regression testing
  - Feature flags for gradual rollout
  - All Story 1.1 tests maintained (25/25 passing)

**Risk 2: GridFS Performance Issues**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - File size limits enforced (e.g., 10MB per file)
  - Streaming upload/download (no memory buffering)
  - MongoDB Atlas auto-scaling for storage
  - Monitoring for slow queries

**Risk 3: UK Validation Accuracy**
- **Severity:** Medium
- **Mitigation:**
  - Comprehensive regex patterns for UK formats
  - 13 validation tests covering edge cases
  - Optional validation (doesn't block legacy data)
  - UI-level validation as additional layer

### Rollback Plan

**If Epic 1 needs to be rolled back:**

1. **Stop using new endpoints** - Frontend reverts to legacy `/api/entries/*`
2. **Verify data integrity** - Confirm no data loss in existing collections
3. **Remove new collections** - Drop domain collections if needed
4. **Document rollback reason** - Log why rollback occurred for future planning

**Rollback Time:** < 10 minutes
**Data Loss Risk:** Zero (new domain system independent of existing bills/categories)

## Technical Notes

### Technology Choices

**Why MongoDB GridFS for Documents?**
- Already using MongoDB (no new infrastructure)
- Handles files > 16MB (BSON document limit)
- Built-in chunking and streaming
- Metadata storage alongside file data
- Consistent with existing MongoDB patterns

**Why Domain-Specific Schemas?**
- Type safety for domain-specific fields
- Validation at database level
- Better query performance (indexes on relevant fields)
- Clear separation of concerns
- Easier to extend individual domains

**Why Clean Slate Approach (Not Migration)?**
- Per PRD: Legacy bills collection has minimal data worth preserving
- Manual re-entry allows users to review and update information
- Avoids complexity and risk of automated migration
- New architecture starts fresh without legacy compatibility constraints
- Users can reference old system while building new records

### Architecture Decisions

1. **New collections independent of old ones** - Clean slate approach per PRD
2. **Common fields in all domains** - Enables cross-domain features (renewals)
3. **User-scoped records** - Multi-user support from day one
4. **GridFS for documents** - Scalable file storage without vendor lock-in
5. **UK-specific validation** - Sort codes, NI numbers, registration plates, postcodes
