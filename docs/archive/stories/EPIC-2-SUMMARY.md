## 📊 Epic Overview

**Goal:** Remove legacy Bills/Accounts/Categories system, migrate Bank Import functionality to domain architecture, and establish clean domain-first user experience.

**Context:** Epic 1 successfully delivered domain architecture (8 domains, 180+ tests) but didn't retire the old system. Users currently see two parallel navigation systems, creating confusion.

**Why Epic 2:**
- ✅ Completes migration vision from PRD
- ✅ Eliminates user confusion from dual navigation
- ✅ Preserves valuable Bank Import (HSBC parser)
- ✅ Unlocks productivity through domain-aware import

**Key Changes:**
- Update `web/src/components/Layout.tsx` (remove lines 150-169)

**Key Changes:**
- Create `src/scripts/archive-legacy-data.js` (migration script)

## 🎓 Learning Notes (For Calvin)

**BMAD Methodology Applied:**
- ✅ Used `*correct-course` command to analyze gap between PRD and implementation
- ✅ Worked through change-checklist incrementally (learning mode)
- ✅ Created comprehensive Sprint Change Proposal for approval
- ✅ Documented decisions with rationale (not just "what" but "why")
- ✅ Created session persistence documents (Epic 2 Summary, tracking files)

**Key BMAD Concepts Used:**
- **Change Navigation:** Systematic response to discovered issues
- **Epic Scoping:** Clean separation of "Build New" (Epic 1) vs "Retire Old" (Epic 2)
- **Risk Assessment:** Identified risks early, planned mitigations
- **User Collaboration:** Your decisions (Option A/B) shaped Epic 2 structure
- **Documentation First:** PRD/Story files guide implementation, not afterthought

**Why This Works:**
- Clear separation of concerns (Epic 1 stable, Epic 2 builds on it)
- Granular stories allow stopping/starting across sessions
- Documentation captures context so you can resume anytime
- Test-driven approach ensures no regressions
