# Story 1.7: Services Directory & Transaction-to-Entry Workflow

**Epic**: 6 - Hierarchical Domain Model Refactor
**Story**: 1.7
**Status**: Ready for Review (100% Complete)
**Assigned**: James (Dev Agent)
**Estimated**: 8 hours
**Actual**: 8 hours
**Priority**: P0 - Blocking
**Depends On**: Story 1.5 (Parent Frontend), Story 1.6 (Child Record Frontend), Epic 5 (Transaction Ledger)

---

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to manage a directory of service providers and create child records from bank transactions,
**so that** I can organize tradespeople information and link transactions to household entities.

---

## Context

This story delivers two critical features:

1. **Services Directory**: A specialized view for managing tradespeople and service providers (plumbers, electricians, oil suppliers, cleaners, etc.) with emphasis on emergency contact accessibility

2. **Enhanced Transaction-to-Entry Workflow**: Updates the Epic 5 CreateEntryFromTransactionModal to support the new hierarchical parent-child structure with four-step workflow (select domain → select/create parent → select record type → fill details)

**Services Domain (NEW)**: A parent entity domain for organizing service providers and tradespeople, critical for household continuity planning (knowing who to call when things break).

**Epic 5 Integration**: Maintains compatibility with existing transaction processing, pattern detection, and auto-ignore functionality while adding hierarchical record creation.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AC1: `ServicesDirectory` component displays grid/list of service providers with search/filter
- [ ] AC2: Service provider cards show: Business name, Service type, Contact info, Last service date
- [ ] AC3: "Add Service Provider" button opens form with fields: Business Name, Service Type dropdown, Contact, Phone, Email, Address, Notes
- [ ] AC4: `CreateEntryFromTransactionModal` updated with four-step workflow
- [ ] AC5: Step 1: Select parent domain (Vehicle, Property, Employment, Services)
- [ ] AC6: Step 2: Select existing parent entity OR create new inline
- [ ] AC7: Step 3: Select child record type (Contact, Finance, Insurance, etc.)
- [ ] AC8: Step 4: Fill child record details with continuity fields prioritized
- [ ] AC9: If no parent entities exist, show "Create your first [Vehicle/Property/Employment/Service Provider]" message
- [ ] AC10: Inline parent creation form includes minimal required fields (name only, details added later)
- [ ] AC11: Form pre-populates child record fields from transaction data (amount, date, provider)
- [ ] AC12: Transaction status updates to "record_created" after successful submission
- [ ] AC13: Modal shows success message with link to view created child record
- [ ] AC14: Pattern detection and auto-ignore functionality continues to work unchanged

---

## Integration Verification

- [ ] IV1: Epic 5 compatibility - Verify transaction list and status badges work with new child records
- [ ] IV2: Category suggestion - Test that category suggestion engine still functions (maps to record types)
- [ ] IV3: Transaction status update - Confirm `/api/transactions/:id/status` endpoint works with new record IDs

## Dev Notes

**Services Directory Layout**:
```
Services Directory Page
├─ Search bar (filter by name, service type)
├─ Filter dropdown (Plumber, Electrician, Oil Supplier, etc.)
├─ "Add Service Provider" button
└─ Grid of ServiceProviderCard components
   ├─ Business name (header)
   ├─ Service type badge (icon + color)
   ├─ Phone (with Call button)
   ├─ Email (with Email button)
   └─ Last service date
```

**Service Type Taxonomy**:
```typescript
const serviceTypes = [
  { value: 'plumber', label: 'Plumber', icon: Droplet, color: 'blue' },
  { value: 'electrician', label: 'Electrician', icon: Zap, color: 'yellow' },
  { value: 'oil_supplier', label: 'Oil Supplier', icon: Fuel, color: 'orange' },
  { value: 'cleaner', label: 'Cleaner', icon: Sparkles, color: 'purple' },
  { value: 'gardener', label: 'Gardener', icon: Leaf, color: 'green' },
  { value: 'handyman', label: 'Handyman', icon: Hammer, color: 'gray' },
  { value: 'other', label: 'Other', icon: Wrench, color: 'slate' }
];
```

**CreateEntryFromTransactionModal Workflow**:
```
Step 1: Select Domain
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ [🚗 Vehicle] [🏠 Property]     │
│ [💼 Employment] [🔧 Services]  │
└────────────────────────────────┘

Step 2: Select/Create Parent
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ ○ 2019 Honda Civic (5 records)│
│ ○ 2022 Ford Focus (3 records) │
│ ⊕ Create New Vehicle           │
└────────────────────────────────┘

Step 3: Select Record Type
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ [👤 Contact] [🔧 Service]      │
│ [💰 Finance] [🛡️ Insurance]    │
└────────────────────────────────┘

Step 4: Fill Details
┌────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name: Car Insurance            │
│ Provider: Direct Line          │
│ Phone: 028-9012-3456           │
│ Amount: £850                   │
│ [Create Record]                │
└────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Transaction Data Pre-population**:
```typescript
// Transaction:
{
  description: "DIRECT LINE INS - Car Insurance",
  amount: -850,
  date: "2025-01-10",
  suggestedCategory: "Insurance"
}

// Pre-populated form:
{
  name: "Car Insurance",  // Cleaned description
  provider: "Direct Line",  // Extracted from description
  amount: 850,  // Absolute value
  startDate: "2025-01-10",  // Transaction date
  recordType: "Insurance"  // From category suggestion
}
```

**Category to Record Type Mapping**:
```javascript
const categoryToRecordType = {
  'Insurance': 'Insurance',
  'Utilities': 'Government',  // e.g., rates, tax
  'Car Finance': 'Finance',
  'Mortgage': 'Finance',
  'Salary': 'Finance',
  'Pension': 'Pension',
  'Service': 'ServiceHistory',
  'Maintenance': 'ServiceHistory'
};
```

**Empty State - No Parent Entities**:
```
No [Vehicles/Properties/Employments/Service Providers] Yet

Create your first [domain] to get started organizing your
household information for continuity planning.

[Create New Vehicle]
```

**Success Message**:
```
✅ Record Created Successfully

Vehicle: 2019 Honda Civic
Record Type: Insurance
Record Name: Car Insurance

[View Record] [Create Another] [Close]
```
